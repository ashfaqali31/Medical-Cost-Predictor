# Medical-Cost-Predictor

# Healthcare Cost Prediction Project

## Project Overview
The **Healthcare Cost Prediction Project** aims to accurately forecast individual healthcare costs using a dataset containing patient demographics and health-related information. This project goes beyond simple predictions by offering advanced segmentation, personalized recommendations, and anomaly detection to optimize healthcare spending.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Medical Cost Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)
- **Description:** Contains information on patient demographics, health indicators, and healthcare costs.
  
## Mentor
**Prof. Dr. Talha Ali Khan**

## Objectives
- **Predict healthcare costs** using machine learning models.
- **Segment patients** based on health profiles for personalized cost-saving strategies.
- **Provide prescriptive analytics** to recommend actionable interventions.
- **Detect cost anomalies** that could indicate inefficiencies or fraud.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and feature engineering (BMI categories, age brackets, health metrics).
   - Outlier analysis for anomaly detection.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing healthcare costs by demographic factors.
   - Geospatial and segmentation analysis.
3. **Advanced Segmentation & Personalization**
   - Clustering techniques (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering).
   - Personalized cost-saving recommendations.
4. **Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics**
   - Machine Learning models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
   - Simulated cost-saving interventions with ROI analysis.
5. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Techniques: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor.
   - Identifying unusual cost patterns.
6. **Data Visualization**
   - **Tools:** Power BI, Tableau.
   - **Dashboards:** Cost drivers, patient segments, predictive vs. actual costs.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Accurate cost prediction models** with actionable insights.
- **Segmented patient profiles** for customized healthcare strategies.
- **Detection of anomalous spending patterns** for fraud and inefficiency detection.
- **Interactive dashboards** for data-driven decision-making.

## Novelty & Uniqueness
- **Holistic approach:** Clustering, prescriptive analytics, and anomaly detection.
- **Actionable interventions:** ROI analysis for healthcare cost optimization.
- **Anomaly detection for quality insights:** Beyond prediction, focusing on cost irregularities.

## Technical Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Libraries:** SHAP (feature importance), statsmodels (statistical analysis), sklearn (clustering), isolationforest (anomaly detection)

## Challenges & Mitigation
- **Data complexity:** Addressed through feature engineering and visualization.
- **Balancing accuracy & interpretability:** Using models like SHAP.
- **Handling outliers:** Using anomaly detection instead of removing them.

## Conclusion
This project aims to go beyond traditional predictive analytics by offering a **comprehensive, data-driven approach** to healthcare cost management. The combination of predictive modeling, segmentation, anomaly detection, and prescriptive analytics makes this project highly valuable for the healthcare and insurance sectors.
